# Sneeek: Ethernet Versus Mode

## Idea
- Support multiple players (up to 6 or so?) to play some super fancy snake game on a huge map
- Host the game on a separate pc
- ???
- Profit

## Short setup
- Host launches `host.py`
- Clients launch `Sneeek.py`
    - Insert host IP and chose your name
    - Connect
    - Check the ready button and press play
- Enjoy! :)
